# Angular Weather App
This is my demo app to check weather based on Angular JS (single page application).  It uses the Open Weather Map API and pulls the data based on the city provided.  Currently, it defaults to Toronto, ON Canada.  Please note that I have removed my API from the code.  In order to use it, an API key needs to be provided.

The page loads with a city selection input defaulted to Toronto.  On the submit, the page will change to the forecast page and show the days forecast based on the city provided.  User can change the number of days provided (2/5/7).  Currently default to 5 days.

My Current Wishlist:

1.  Need to add an error message if the city is not found.
2.  Need to add a way to figure out the weather so I can change the weather image
3.  Center the forecasts if it's 2 or 5 days somehow in bootstrap
